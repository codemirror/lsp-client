## 6.1.1 (2025-09-02)

### Bug fixes

Properly declare the @codemirror/lint dependency.

## 6.1.0 (2025-08-23)

### New features

`LSPClient` now accepts an array of extensions directly in its configuration. These can also add behavior (client capabilities and notification handlers) to the client itself.

The new `serverDiagnostics` extension makes the client receive diagnostics from the server, and show them via the CodeMirror linter.

The new `languageServerExtensions` function provides an extension bundle interface, that works for client extensions as well as editor extensions.

`LSPClient` now has a `plugin` method for conveniently creating an editor extension. `LSPPlugin.create` is deprecated in favor of this method.

## 6.0.1 (2025-08-05)

Fix a bug that prevented reuse of completions when adding to the completed identifier.

Properly render plain strings included in arrays for a hover tooltip's `content` data as Markdown content.

## 6.0.0 (2025-07-02)
